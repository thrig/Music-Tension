=head1 NAME

Music::Tension::PlompLevelt - Plomp-Levelt consonance curve calculations

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Beta interface! Will likely change without notice!

  use Music::Tension::PlompLevelt;
  my $tension = Music::Tension::PlompLevelt->new;

  $tension->frequences(440, 880);

  $tension->pitches(69, 81);

  $tension->vertical([qw/60 64 67/]);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Plomp-Levelt consonance curve calculations based on work by William
Sethares and others (L</"SEE ALSO"> for links). None of this will make
sense without some grounding in music theory and the referenced papers.

Parsing music into a form suitable for use by this module and practical
uses of the results are left as an exercise to the reader. Consult the
C<eg/> directory of this module's distribution for example programs.

The calculations use some number of harmonics, depending on the
amplitude profile used, or frequency information supplied. Finding
details on the harmonics for a particular instrument may require
consulting a book, or performing spectral analysis on recordings of a
particular instrument (e.g. via Audacity), or fiddling around with a
synthesizer, and likely making simplifying assumptions on what gets fed
into this module.

=head1 CAVEATS

Other music writers indicate that the partials should be ignored, for
example Harry Partch: "Long experience... convinces me that it is
preferable to ignore partials as a source of musical materials. The ear
is not impressed by partials as such. The faculty--the prime faculty--of
the ear is the perception of small-numbered intervals, 2/1, 3/2, 4/3,
etc. and the ear cares not a whit whether these intervals are in or out
of the overtone series." (Genesis of a Music, 1947). (However, note that
this declamation predates the work by Sethares and others.)

On the plus side, this method does rate an augmented triad as more
dissonant than a diminished triad (though that test was with distortions
from equal temperament), which agrees with a study mentioned over in
L<Music::Tension::Cope> that the Cope method finds the opposite of.

See also "Harmony Perception: Harmoniousness is more than the sum of
interval consonance" by Norman Cook (2009) though that method should
probably be in a different module than this one.

=head1 METHODS

Any method may B<croak> if something is awry with the input. Methods are
inherited from the parent class, L<Music::Tension>. Unlike
L<Music::Tension::Cope>, this module is very sensitive to the register
of the pitches involved, so input pitches should ideally be from the
MIDI note numbers and in the proper register. Or instead use frequencies
via methods that accept those (especially to avoid the distortions of
equal temperament tuning).

The tension number depends heavily on the equation (and constants to
said equation), and should not be considered comparable to any other
tension modules in this distribution, and only to other tension values
from this module if the same harmonics were used in all calculations.
Also, the tension numbers could very easily change between releases of
this module.

=over 4

=item B<new> I<optional params>

Constructor. Accepts various optional parameters.

  my $tension = Music::Tension::PlompLevelt->new(
    amplitudes => {
      made_up_numbers => [ 42, 42, ... ],
      ...
    },
    default_amp_profile => 'made_up_numbers',
    normalize_amps      => 1,
    reference_frequency => 442,
  );

=over 4

=item *

I<amplitudes> specifies a hash reference that should contain
named amplitude sets and an array reference of amplitude values
for each harmonic.

=item *

I<default_amp_profile> what amplitude profile to use by default.
Available options pre-coded into the module include:

  ones
  pianowire-plucked
  pianowire-soft
  pianowire-medium    * the default
  pianowire-hard

These all have amplitude values for six harmonics.

=item *

I<normalize_amps> if true, normalizes the amplitude values such that
they sum up to one.

=item *

I<reference_frequency> sets the MIDI reference frequency, by default 440
(Hz). Used by B<pitch2freq> conversion called by the B<pitches> and
B<vertical> methods.

=back

=item B<frequencies> I<freq_or_ref1>, I<freq_or_ref2>

Method that accepts two frequencies, or two array references containing
the harmonics and amplitudes of such. Returns tension as a number.

  # default harmonics will be filled in
  $tension->frequencies(440, 880);

  # custom harmonics
  $tension->frequencies(
    [ {amp=>1,    freq=>440}, {amp=>0.5,  freq=>880},  ... ],
    [ {amp=>0.88, freq=>880}, ... ],
    ...
  );

The harmonics need not be the same number, nor use the same frequencies
nor amplitudes. This allows comparison of different frequencies bearing
different harmonic profiles. The resulting tension numbers are not
normalized to anything; making them range from zero to one can be solved
something like:

  use List::Util qw/max/;

  my @results;
  for my $f ( 440 .. 880 ) {
    push @results, [ $f, $tension->frequencies( 440, $f ) ];
  }
  my $max = max map $_->[1], @results;
  for my $r (@results) {
    printf "%.1f %.3f\n", $r->[0], $r->[1] / $max;
  }

See the C<eg/> directory under this module's distribution for
example code containing the above.

=item B<pitches> I<pitch1>, I<pitch2>

Accepts two integers (ideally MIDI note numbers) and converts those to
frequencies via B<pitch2freq> (which does the MIDI number to frequency
conversion equation) and then calls B<frequencies> with those values.
Use B<frequencies> with the proper Hz if a non-equal temperament tuning
is involved. Returns tension as a number.

=item B<vertical> I<pitch_set>

Given a pitch set (an array reference of integer pitch numbers that are
ideally MIDI numbers), converts those pitches to frequencies via
B<pitch2freq>, then calls B<frequencies> for the first pitch compared in
turn with each subsequent in the set. In scalar context, returns the
total tension, while in list context returns the total, min, max, and an
array reference of individual tensions of the various intervals present.
